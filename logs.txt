[4:12:57 AM] [semantic-release] [@semantic-release/commit-analyzer] › ℹ  Analyzing commit: fix(utils): handle ArrayBuffer views in processBody

Updated the \`processBody\` function to correctly handle \`ArrayBuffer\` views.

Previously, \`ArrayBuffer\` views were not being correctly identified, causing them to be stringified as JSON. This change adds a specific check for \`ArrayBuffer.isView\` to ensure they are passed through as-is.

[4:12:57 AM] [semantic-release] [@semantic-release/commit-analyzer] › ℹ  Analyzing commit: fix(core): ensure response body is not consumed by middlewares

Refactored the request function to prevent response middlewares from consuming the response body.

Previously, if a middleware read the response body, it would be consumed and unavailable for subsequent middlewares or the final resolver.

This change introduces a Proxy to intercept \`body\` and \`bodyUsed\` properties, ensuring the original response body is always available. The middlewares now operate on a clone of the response, and their modifications are merged into the final response.
